## Build for Production

a. Add a "build" script to your `package.json` file, located in the root of your project, if not already present. Edit the "scripts" section to look like this:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite",
  "build": "vite build"
}
```

b. Ensure that the "type" in your package.json is set to "module":

json
```
"type": "module",
```

c. Open your terminal and run the build script:
```
npm run build
```

d. After the build completes, a "dist" named folder will be created. This is the folder you need to push into production for deployment.
